# AI Science Chatbot

This repository contains the code for an AI chatbot that generates responses to questions about science. The chatbot uses the `LlamaForCausalLM` model from the `transformers` library to generate responses.

## Project Structure

The key files in this project are:

- `main.py`: This is the main script that contains the `execute` function where the chatbot logic resides. 
- `ignite.py`: This script is used to start the application.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following libraries:

- `torch`
- `transformers`
- `openfabric_pysdk`

Please ensure these libraries are installed before running the scripts.

## How to Run

The application can be executed in two ways:

1. Locally by running the `start.sh` script.
2. In a Docker container using the `Dockerfile`.

## About the Chatbot

The chatbot takes in a list of text strings as input and returns a list of responses generated by the Llama model. Each input string is treated as a question about science. The chatbot uses a constant scientific context ("The answer must be scientific, factual and precise.") to guide the model's responses.
